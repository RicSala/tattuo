// REVIEW: Not sure if we can implement the "isOwner" middleware here, because we would probably need database access to check if the user is the owner of the resource
// and the middleware is run on the edge... not sure if we can access the database from the edge

// TODO: we also need to protect the api routes, so that only the owner of the resource can access them
